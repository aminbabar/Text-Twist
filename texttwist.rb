# Text Twist
# When the user calls the playâ€‹ method, the program starts a new game. Each game 
# is composed of one or more rounds, during which the user guesses words using 6 
# specific letters. In each round, the program chooses a random 6-letter word 
# from the supplied dictionary, and useS those 6 letters as the letters for the
# round. It then finds any word in the dictionary composed entirely of 3 or more 
# of these 6 letters; these are the words that the user should guess this round. 
# The game can be quit by calling on EXIT.
